Hi, I’m Fabio. On the internet, I’m also known as FZero. Nice to meet you too. I’m a Brazilian (from Rio) living in Toronto and loving it.

Now you’ll say “how could you leave such a beautiful tropical paradise” and so on, but believe me: while Brazil is nice to visit, you wouldn’t want to live there for long.

What else? I make [music](/music). I’m also a [programmer](/programming). I cook a bit too. Finally, I have several other sites and profiles elsewhere.

You can also [follow me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/fzero), if you want.
