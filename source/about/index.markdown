Hi, Iâ€™m Fabio - also known as FZero on the interwebz.

I code [music](/music) and produce [code](/programming). I cook a bit too. Someone should write a study on musicians/programmers/food enthusiasts; there seems to be a bunch of us out there.

Of course I have several other sites and profiles [in several places](/elsewhere).

You can [follow me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/fzero), if you want.
