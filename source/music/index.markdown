My first instrument ever was the computer. I made electronic music first, using trackers, and after years I finally learned how to play… drums!

My main music project (band?) is called [No Step](http://nostep.ca). It’s not my first; for a long time I had a band called [Gerador Zero](http://geradorzero.com) that was a lot of fun and had some success in the 00s, but no native english speaker can pronounce “Gerador Zero” correctly. Just try it.

I also had several other projects along the way: [Concert for Harp and Notebook](http://geradorzero.bandcamp.com/album/concert-for-harp-and-notebook), [MECHUPA](http://geradorzero.com/mechupa/) and I still maintain a podcast called [BitBang!](http://bitbang.ca). I also post some in-progress tracks to [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/fzero) from time to time.

I’ve also worked on [soundtracks](http://fzero.bandcamp.com), TV spots, remixes and general music/audio production/mixing/mastering for artists of varied styles.

If you’re interested in booking me to DJ, perform, mix/master your tracks or do any other audio-related job, [talk to me](mailto:talk@[REMOVE-THIS-IF-YOU-ARE-A-HUMAN]fzero.ca).
