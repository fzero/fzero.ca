I started programming when I was 8, and I've been working with the web since the late 90s. My first computer was a [cheap Brazilian clone](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRVI-nxkAO8) of the [Sinclair ZX81](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81), with 16Kb of expanded (!) RAM.

I started working on the front end, dealing with design, Photoshop, Flash, UI/UX, HTML, CSS and slowly developed an interest on back-end programming. So I learned PHP, delved into Linux system administration, then Python and Ruby. I make an active effort to test every single new web application that seems interesting.

Right now I'm what you could call a full-stack web developer. I spent a few years working on the back-end with Ruby on Rails, developing [Mondia Media](http://www.mondiamedia.com/)'s mobile e-commerce and, more recently, the APIs behind the [ScoreMobile apps](http://mobile.thescore.com/). I turned back to Javascript recently and I've been experimenting both with UI development and server-side Javascript (mainly [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)). I'm also looking into [Go](http://golang.org) for a few personal projects. It's still a bit rough around the edges, but I feel it's going to become one of the main web back-end languages relatively soon.

I also play regularly with virtual machines and cloud servers running several different Linux distributions ([Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) is my current darling).
