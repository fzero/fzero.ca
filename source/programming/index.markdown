I’ve been working with the web since the late 90s, living through the rise and fall of tendencies, technologies and bubbles.

I started working at the front end, dealing with design, user interface, Photoshop, Flash (oh the useless, annoying web intros!), HTML, CSS and slowly developed an interest on back-end. So I learned PHP, then Linux system administration, Python and Ruby. I make an active effort to test every single new web application that seems interesting.

Ruby on Rails is basically what I do right now. It pays the bills and it’s fun to work with (specially in comparison to Java and PHP). I also do some Python for myself – mostly in things not web-related – and play with virtual machines running several different Linux distributions.
