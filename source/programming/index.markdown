I’ve been working with the web since the late 90s, living through the rise and fall of tendencies, technologies and bubbles.

I started working at the front end, dealing with design, user interface, Photoshop, Flash (oh the useless, annoying web intros!), HTML, CSS and slowly developed an interest on back-end. So I learned PHP, then Linux system administration, Python and Ruby. I make an active effort to test every single new web application that seems interesting.

Right now I'm what you could call a full-stack web developer. I spent a few years working on the back-end with Ruby on Rails, powering the APIs behind the [ScoreMobile apps](http://mobile.thescore.com/). I turned back to Javascript recently and I've been experimenting both with UI development and server-side Javascript (mainly [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)). I also do some Python for myself – mostly in things not web-related – and play with virtual machines running several different Linux distributions ([Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) is my current darling).
