The [fourth Hy Brazil Compilation](http://chicodub.bandcamp.com/album/hy-brazil-vol-4-fresh-electronic-music-from-brazil-2014) was released this week, including a new track by yours truly! What's that, you ask? Well...

> Hy Brazil is a compilation series that aims to map and promote the new music produced in Brazil focusing on electronic and experimental sounds.

The compilation was curated by [Chico Dub](https://www.facebook.com/chicodub), who's behind a number of music festivals and related events in Brazil. Apparently they don't mind the fact I don't live there anymore and asked me for a track anyway. The reception has been pretty good so far, including a [very nice writeup on SPIN](http://www.spin.com/articles/hy-brazil-vol-4-brazilian-electronic-music/).

My new track **The Borly Dossier** is also available on [Bandcamp](http://nostep.ca), along with the previously unreleased **Walker**. This makes for a tiny EP with stupid quantities of bass. Seriously, crank up _dat subwoofer_ or wear decent headphones. You'll miss all the fun otherwise.

More new music coming soon(ish).
