I already <a href="http://youtu.be/5g4nxBHk6oY">talked about this elsewhere</a>, but in case you missed, I started a new music project (band?) called <a href="http://nostep.ca" title="No Step - Official website!">No Step</a>. I'm pretty committed to make more music this year, so the goal is to <strong>release a new track every two weeks</strong>. Not all of them are going to be No Step originals - I'm giving myself the option to make remixes and edits too (still counts, right?).

I've released two original tracks so far:

You can download the songs (name your price!) at the official (gasp!) <a href="http://nostep.ca" title="No Step - Official website!">No Step website</a>. Also, follow <a href="http://twitter.com/nostepmusic" title="No Step on Twitter">No Step on Twitter</a> and check out the page over at <a href="http://radio3.cbc.ca/artists/No-Step" title="No Step at CBC Radio 3">CBC Radio 3</a>. Soooo Canadian! :-)
