iOS = collection of sandboxes
Android = a real system

In iOS every app lives in its own separate universe by default and can't really talk to anything else besides iTunes. This has security benefits, but makes it very difficult to integrate with other apps and the external world.

I can only put files in iOS using iTunes.

Lots of iOS apps resort to sending stuff to Dropbox to share things with other apps, or create virtual FTP servers to bypass iTunes.

The few common access areas that could work as a filesystem have limited access.

If I start reading a cool page someone linked on Facebook, I can't share it easily on Twitter or send it to my Pocket to read it later (or even email it to a friend).

I can copy the link using a ridiculously clunky process


Android has a real filesystem. This makes sharing data between apps easy right from the start.

Most devices act as USB drives, either plain storage or as USB media device.

Instead of making every app implement its own sharing functionality, Android provides it for free. Any app can share anything with everything else.

Apps that have their own internal browser are the exception. Links usually open in the (excellent) Chrome for Android.


So, IMO, if you have a tablet mainly to browse the web, write texts and similar tasks, Android wins hands down.

On the other hand, iOS is unbeatable for games, making music and other media-related tasks.
