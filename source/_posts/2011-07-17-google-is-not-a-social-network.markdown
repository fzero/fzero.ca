There, I said it. Actually I wasn't even the first one to say it, but I strongly agree. While it has a rather strong social thing going on, Google+ is actually a really cool platform for personal sites and (micro)blogging, which happens to make it very easy to share stuff with your friends.

The strongest argument for this is the profile page. Before you drop to the comment box without reading the rest and/or go out shouting "but it's just like Facebook!!1!", step back and look carefully at the differences.

First of all, Google+ is a lot less <em>noisy</em>; there's not much besides your posts, your name/picture and the circles. The profile page on Facebook, on the other hand, is a mish-mash of information about your friends, groups and updates from apps, all in small fonts surrounded by a heavy helping of lines and shaded rectangles. On top of that, your page is actually a "wall" where everybody and their dog can post (with your permission, of course).

On Google+ no such thing exists. <strong>Your</strong> content is front and center - and it's only yours. You could actually use your profile as a blog, since get comment moderation and threading for free.

But the killer feature is the personalization that comes with the Circles. If someone you don't know looks at your profile, s/he will only see your public content - just like whatever you post to Twitter or, again, a blog.

Now, if someone in your Extended Circles looks at it, a few additional posts will show. This is for people who have some idea of who you are, but with whom you don't want to share much.

Finally, the people who are actually in your circles will be presented with different kinds of posts depending on their relationship with you. Everything is contextualized and truly - wait for it - personal.

This only works because everybody has a Google account these days. After all, Gmail, Picasa, Youtube, Calendar and Docs all share the same login. Most people are <strong>always</strong> logged in and don't really think about it.

(If you work with information security, you probably just freaked out a little right now. I'll give you time for the feeling to sink in.)

Because of all this, I doubt that Google+ will kill Facebook anytime soon. Sure, lots of people who don't care about the games and pokes are going to abandon it, but this won't change the fact that Google+ has a different rhythm to it, more akin to Twitter and Tumblr than posting updates to your wall.

If I had to bet, I'd say that Twitter and Foursquare have a lot more to lose, since it's pretty quick and easy to post short updates (with pictures, even) and check-ins (there's no mayorship yet, but most people never cared about it).

So what about Hangout and Huddle? I see both almost as separated "products" that are available firsthand through Google+, but will be present in other places soon. They're both improvements to Google Talk, pushing features that were one-to-one into a group context.
