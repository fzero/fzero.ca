Instagram debacle, reactions, and TOS changes

free products = you're the product yadda yadda

Not only poorly handled, but they could have simply done something smarter: charging. That's why I resurrected my Flick account.

Photostream is way better than Instagram, and that's just one feature.

Instagram actually started screwing up before the TOS change, when they took out Twitter card integration. Well, guess what? This means Flickr is even better as an option now.

IFTTT filters.

Actually I would love if all free services I depend on had a paid option. Flickr has it and it rules. Google hasn't figured this out yet, and the Gapps account is too expensive for regular users.

That's why I have a regular email elsewhere, if GMail fails. It's my serious address.
