I swear I tried, but I couldn’t come up with a decent idea for the Linkin Park remix contest. I really thought I had it going for a while, but then it fell apart on top of the suckage of the original material. All I have to show for it is the track alignment mix, since LP wasn’t even decent enough to provide a proper multitrack.
