I've been working with Ruby/Rails for a long time (in internet years at least). I started for the same reason as everybody else: it's a fun language to work with, and Rails was probably the first framework to implement the MVC pattern in a way that makes sense for web development. Developers were happy with the simplicity of the language, startup founders liked being able to put out a simple database-driven website in days instead of weeks and, despite early complaints about performance, Rails thrived.

Fast forward to 2013 and [some are claiming](http://i.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1oi8wd/ruby_is_a_dying_language/) [Ruby is dying](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6553767), and Rails isn't the first platform choice for start-ups anymore.

Whether Ruby is "dying" or not is disputable, but it's a fact that Rails isn't the hipster platform of choice anymore. The new hotness is *the real time web*, dude. Single-page apps, asynchronous connections, websockets!

Well, I'm all for it. No, seriously, it's cool stuff. The problem is that, of all languages anyone could pick to make this happen - which of course include [Ruby](http://cramp.in/), [Python](http://www.tornadoweb.org) and even [PHP](http://socketo.me/) - people picked Javascript.
