I've been working with Ruby and Rails for a long time (in internet years at least). I started for the same reason as everybody else: it's a fun language to work with, and Rails was probably the first framework to implement the MVC pattern in a way that makes sense for web development. Developers were happy with the simplicity of the language, startup founders liked being able to put out a simple database-driven website in weeks and, despite early complaints about performance, Rails thrived.

Fast forward to 2013 and [some are claiming](http://i.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1oi8wd/ruby_is_a_dying_language/) [Ruby is dying](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6553767) and RoR isn't the first choice for start-ups anymore.
