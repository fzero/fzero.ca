I was listening to old Depeche Mode songs today and realized that if <strong>Nothing</strong> was mixed to sound like one of those shoddy electro-house singles, it would show every wannabe blogger/”producer” how crappy they are.

So I just went and did it. What you’re hearing now is the product of, um, 20 minutes of work. Anything more and it would be too elaborate for your average teenage to whip up in one week.

Jokes aside, it didn’t turn out awful, just kinda bad. It’s just what you get when you follow a formula (which, by the way, proves the point nicely). I’m even thinking of submitting it to some hipster music blogs to see what happens. What do you think?
