It took almost four years and a major software update, but I'm finally ready to admit NI Maschine isn't for me. 

I'm a bit surprised, really. I come from a sampling background and my first productions were made using trackers running on DOS (Remember the 90s? I do. I was there). I bought an MPC 2000 when I was ready to take my tracks to the stage and I pushed it to its absolute limits, so I feel totally at home with a lovely array of 16 rubberized pads.

So it's more than a bit obvious I was interested when I first heard of Maschine. An MPC-like design with all the convenience of editing samples, programs and sequences in the computer? Shut up and take my money! But the theory doesn't always work in practice. Maschine is indeed very straightforward and quick to get a groove going, but once you reach a certain point you can't help but wish to have a full DAW at your disposal. NI knows this - that's why Maschine also runs as a plugin. And that's where your problems start.

## Double the sequencers, double the fun?

If you sequence your grooves in Maschine (and that's the whole point after all), you'll have to deal with two different arrangements and two separate mixing busses, and this **will** become a mess. Any pattern currently selected on Maschine will start playing immediately whenever you press play on the DAW, regardless of where you are in the arrangement. I've lost count of how many times I had the groove for the chorus playing on top of a breakdown and vice-versa. It's extremely annoying and confusing.

There are two ways to fix this, but both suck. One is creating scenes on Maschine, assigning MIDI notes / control changes to them and remembering to fire them them from the arrangement. Seriously, this is the *bad stuff* from the MPC times, precisely what everyone hoped to avoid when working with a computer. For all practical purposes, Maschine acts as an "external" equipment MIDI-synced to your DAW in a way that's not particularly clever.

The second way is exporting every pattern in every group to audio using Maschine's drag and drop feature - which works, but it's a pain in the ass - or sending the plugin's outputs to multiple channels and recording them to regular audio channels. This obviously means you'll have to re-record all the audio if you change a groove later. It's yet another consequence of Maschine trying too hard to act like external hardware. So annoying.

## Wait but why?

Is it all bad? No, not really. Maschine does some things are brilliantly, but it isn't for me. And you know what? If you use Ableton Live as your main DAW (or Bitwig, for that matter), it's probably not for you either.

For you see, Live does everything Maschine does. Yes, seriously. And I'm not even considering a specialized controller like Push here. Only in a more integrated and intuitive way. The Drum Rack device does *way more* than Maschine will ever do, with the added benefit of letting me drag bits and pieces directly from the arrangement into the that I take their features for granted. If my DAW already has ridiculous groove creation and editing features, I don't really need anything else. 

(live/bitwig you can use any controller)
(maschine is just a subset of drum racks)

(vendor lock-in)
(controller is useless without the computer)

(not selling it - the plugin bundle is worth it - but only now)
