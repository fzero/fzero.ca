I always loved this song, and after the intentionally bad remix I made for 'Nothing', I thought DM deserved something better.

I started the remix while learning how to use <a href="http://www.native-instruments.com/#/en/products/producer/maschine/">Native Instruments' Maschine</a> (which kicks major ass, by the way). All the sample-chopping and filtering was made on it. I might still play around with the mix, but this is pretty much the final version.

Enjoy!
