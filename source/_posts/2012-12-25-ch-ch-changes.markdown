In case you're one of my 17 readers, you probably noticed the site's
design has changed recently. This is because we're not running on
Wordpress anymore, but on <strike>sub-atomic quantum entaglement
engines</strike> [Octopress](http://octopress.org/)!

But what exactly does that mean for **you**? Well, the site will load
much faster, for one. It's also very resilient against _l33t h4x0rz_,
which is always a good thing.

For **me** it means I don't have to worry too much about my site going
down if I'm ever featured on [HackerNews](http://news.ycombinator.com)
or [Reddit](http://reddit.com), since there's no interpreter between the
files and what you see. Instead of being a dynamic blogging engine that
reads databases and process templates on the fly, Octopress generates
all necessary files before uploading them. All the webserver has to do
is spit data in your general direction (and it does that *really* fast).

I also took the time to clean up the blog a bit; all photo-posts were
removed, since I already had a copy of those on
[Posterous](http://fzero.posterous.com). This has left only posts with
"actual content" (mandatory quotes, I fear), which should serve as an
incentive for me to stop being lazy and write more.

And what will I write about? Well, taking from 
[my older stuff](/blog/archives), I'd say music, programming and random
ramblings - In other words, a regular blog. A more focused portolio-like
website will come soon, and I'll probably comment on its development
around here.

I know this sounds a bit like a new-year's resolution thing (and I
_know_ what usually happens to those), but I missed having an honest,
*real* blog instead of scattered posts on assorted social networking
sites. Not that I'm abandoning them, but instead of linking to other
people's stuff, it's high time I go back to making stuff other people
would want to link to.

Oh, and before I forget: **happy multi-denomitational food and gifts
holiday!**
