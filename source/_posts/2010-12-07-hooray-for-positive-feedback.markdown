I work as a web developer forÂ <a href="http://thescore.ca/">theScore</a>, and this review was just published by Cnet:
<blockquote>When I see an app like TheScore for iPad, it forces me to think in big-picture terms, as in: this is how sports news was meant to be consumed. Not in some day-old newspaper or tiny iPhone app, but on a big, beautiful screen jam-packed with scores, standings, videos, and blogs.</blockquote>
