I've had this article on draft since the [Instagram TOS debacle](http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/19/3892924/instagram-new-tos-go-into-effect-today), but I didn't finish writing it because of reasons. Life got busy and I lost the timing.

Anyway, the crux of it remains relevant. I won't get into the whole *"if you don't pay for a service, you're the product"* thing since it's been done to hell, but it doesn't make it any less true.

So, I decided to move from Instagram back to [Flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/fzero) when the TOS "controversy" was at its height. I didn't have that many photos or thought they were good enough to be used in ads, but I was a bit pissed off when Instagram decided to [pull out Twitter integration](http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57558128-93/instagram-photos-disappear-from-twitter-feeds/) about one month before that.

I had reached the 200-picture limit on my free account a long time ago, but there I had a service that did **way** more, where I could store full-resolution photos, create sets, use proper geolocation and, on top of everything else, had _proper_ social network integration. A Flickr Pro account costs 25 bucks a year, a very fair price for a full-featured ad-free cloud photo storage service.

### Please let me pay for stuff

It's a known fact that paying for a service makes it more _serious_. Paying legitimizes a commercial relationship; it gives you leverage when you have a complaint, it creates a proper binding contract where you have a say about the services you're using. When you use a service for free, the company can always come back at you and say *"I was being generous, you ungrateful bastard"*.

A good example is [Posterous](http://posterous.com). I've used it for a long time to post pictures and short text posts via email when I didn't have a decent smartphone. Twitter bought them and now the [service is being discontinued](http://thenextweb.com/twitter/2013/02/15/the-posterous-rides-away-as-in-shuts-down-april-30t/). They offered an easy way to download everything as a working website (which I've uploaded [here](/posterous)), but it doesn't change the fact that *it doesn't exist anymore*. If I want to post via email, I'll have to look elsewhere.

Unfortunately, not all "free" services have decent paid options. The biggest example is possibly Google. While I _can_ buy extra storage for Gmail, that doesn't really constitue a proper paid account. Yes, I can sign up for [Google Apps](http://www.google.com/enterprise/apps/business/), but that's _way_ more than most people need and still lacks integration with a few services (Youtube, for example). What if I don't have (or don't want to use) a domain? Would it be so hard to offer a Google Premium account?

I have a non-Google email that I use for serious stuff _precisely_ to have an "exit strategy" if Google ever decides to pull the plug on Gmail. Don't think it can't happen - remember that Google Reader had a loyal following, and was killed anyway.

So please internet, take my money. Use it to remove those annoying ads and create great services for **users**, not shareholders.
